# Physualizer: a particle collision toy

## Usage
Use the fortuna's N,E,S,W buttons to add a force to the particles on screen.
By using the rotary encoder, you can change the amount of force applied.

### note:
This project was originally designed to be a musical instrument, and each
collision between particles would trigger a sound. However, due to time 
constraints, I was not able to get this working. I will probably
keep working on this project as it could be a great tool for creating 
unique rhythms. It is still very satisfying to play with, regardless!

## Editing the program
Most modifications to the program you'd want to make can be done in 
`physics.h`. Here you can change:

 - Number of particles
 - Ball radius
 - Gravity force
 - Coefficient of friction
 - Coefficient of restitution
